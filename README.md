# Resume

This is my resume written using Jekyll :)

## Usage

### Build it locally and print a PDF

1. To [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), run `gem install bundler jekyll` from the command line.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the repo to your local machine.
3. Type `jekyll serve` to render your resume at http://localhost:4000.
4. You can edit the `index.md` file and see the changes live in your browser.
5. Now print the page, and save it as PDF.

### Styling

To change the default style, simply change the variable in the
`_config.yml` file.

## Demo
