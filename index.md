## About

I'm Jose Ramon, an engineer originated from Panama, but currently living in California.

Some of my areas of expertise include software engineering, front-end design, embedded systems, music, and many more! Thinking in a logical and clear way has helped me during my academic and professional career, by being a problem-solver and someone who can be relied on.
